An intelligent travel assistant powered by **LangGraph**, **LangChain**, and **Ollama**.  
It helps you plan trips through natural conversation, including checking current weather, 
giving attraction suggestions, and offering personalized packing tips as its main queries.

## Powered by Travel APIs

This assistant integrates two public APIs to deliver accurate, real-time travel data:

### üî∂ OpenWeatherMap API
Used to retrieve:
- **Current weather** for any city
- **5-day weather forecasts** to help with trip planning and packing

API Website: https://openweathermap.org/api


### üî∑ OpenTripMap API
Used to retrieve:
- **Top-rated attractions** in any given city

API Website: https://dev.opentripmap.org/product

## How to Use
Follow these steps to get the Travel Assistant running on your machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/TomerSivan/Travel-Assistant
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Ensure you are using Python 3.10+

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Install Ollama and Pull a Model
Download Ollama from https://ollama.com and install it locally.
Then, in your terminal, pull a model (Recommended - qwen:4b, Has to support Langchain tools):

```
ollama pull qwen:4b
ollama run qwen:4b
```

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the project root directory with your API keys and selected model:

```
CHAT_MODEL=Qwen3:4b
WEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_key
OPENTRIPMAP_API_KEY=your_opentripmap_key
```

### 5. Run the Assistant
And to finish up and start talking to the assistant chatbot via your terminal
use:

```
python main.py
```

Or directly run the main file.

## Supported Queries & Commands

The Travel Assistant supports natural language queries related to:

Query Type|Example Prompt|Details
-|-|-
Weather|`"What's the weather in Paris?"`|Uses the **OpenWeatherMap API** to retrieve either or both the current weather and a 5-day forecast. This data is integrated into the assistant‚Äôs natural language response.
Attractions|`"What are some places to visit in Rome?"`|Uses the **OpenTripMap API** to fetch top attractions for a city. Also calls the weather tool to tailor suggestions (e.g., avoid outdoor attractions if it's raining).
Packing Tips|`"What should I pack for a trip to Tokyo?"`|No single tool is used directly. Instead, the assistant internally calls both **weather** and **attractions** tools to suggest appropriate clothing, gear, and essentials.
Mixed Intent|`"I'm flying to London‚Äîwhat should I see and pack?"`|The assistant chains multiple tools (weather + attractions) and uses them together to provide detailed activity suggestions and overviews as well as a tailored packing list.

The assistant interprets user intent dynamically and will request needed information for tools.

The Travel Assistant supports user commands:

Command|Effect
-|-
"/exit"|Quit the assistant
"/debug"|Toggle debug output
"/think"|Toggle thought display
"/history"|Show full conversation
"/clear"|Clears up the history of the conversation
"/cmds"|List available commands

## LangGraph Workflow

The Travel Assistant uses a dynamic, tool-aware conversation loop built with **LangGraph**.

The graph consists of two main nodes and a simple routing condition:

**Nodes:**
- `assistant` - the core LLM node responsible for interpreting the user's message, reasoning, and generating tool calls (if needed).
- `tools` - executes any tools requested by the LLM (e.g. current weather, attractions, etc.) and updates the conversation state.

**Control Flow:**
1. ‚û§ Start at the `assistant` node.
2. ‚û§ The LLM interprets the user's message:
   - If tool calls are needed go to `tools`
   - If not end the conversation
3. ‚û§ The `tools` node executes tool calls and updates the state.
4. ‚û§ After tools are run, control returns to `assistant`.
5. ‚û§ This loop continues until no further tools are required.

Below is a simplified diagram of the Travel Assistant's LangGraph structure:
![LangGraph UML Diagram](Examples/langgraph_diagram.JPG)

### Why This Structure?

This setup ensures:
- There is a natural back and forth between reasoning and tools
- LLM re-evaluates its output with tool results
- Tools are only called when needed
- The loop exits cleanly once all goals are fulfilled

## Prompt Engineering
System Prompt:

```
today = datetime.today().strftime("%A, %B %d, %Y")
    return f"""Today is {today}.

You are a helpful and intelligent travel assistant. Your role is to support users with travel-related questions, including:
- Weather at destinations (current or forecast)
- Notable attractions and local experiences
- Packing suggestions tailored to the trip
- General travel tips and trip planning support

Your responses should be:
- Clear and direct
- Structured when helpful (e.g., bullet points or sections)
- Concise when information is missing or unclear

Tool Use & Reasoning Rules:
Use tools only when necessary to improve your response. Always follow these logic dependencies based on what the user asks:
1. If the user asks for **weather**:
    - If they specify **current** or **forecast**, call only the specified tool.
    - If they are vague or just say ‚Äúweather‚Äù, call **both** `get_weather_current` and `get_weather_forecast`.
    - Very important that you only provide weather data do **not** offer suggestions, packing advice, or attractions unless explicitly asked.

2. If the user asks for **activities or attractions**, you must check the weather first.
   - Use the weather conditions to decide what to recommend or avoid (e.g., avoid outdoor spots in rain).

3. If the user asks for **packing advice**, you must check **both** the weather and possible activities.
   - This ensures packing advice is relevant (e.g., umbrella for rain, hiking shoes if hikes are likely).
   - Also provide general packing advice such as important documents (Passport, Medications, Phone, Etc...)

You may request multiple tools in a single message when necessary.
   - For example: packing advice may require using both the weather and attractions tools together.

Avoid repeating the same checks or logic multiple times in your thoughts.
Never assume or include extra sections unless clearly requested. Always base suggestions on actual data from tools.

Conversation Guidance:
- If user input is unclear or incomplete, ask for clarification.
- Do not guess or invent unsupported details.
- Remain professional, efficient, and easy to understand.

### 1. Adding Date
Adds to the prompt today‚Äôs date so the assistant can reason about time related information (especially weather).
```
today = datetime.today().strftime("%A, %B %d, %Y")
return f"""Today is {today}.
```

### 2. Assistant Role
Defines the assistant‚Äôs purpose and task queries. 
focusing on helpfulness, intelligence, and travel-related guidance.
```

### 3. Response Style
Directs the assistant to be structured, clear, and concise and to avoid rambling.
```
Your responses should be:
- Clear and direct
- Structured when helpful (e.g., bullet points or sections)
- Concise when information is missing or unclear
```

### 4. Tool Use & Reasoning Logic
Defines strict logic rules for when and how to use tools. Promotes modularity, avoids overuse, and enforces dependencies between queries and tool calls.

```

### 5. Tool Combination Support
Helps the assistant to bundle multiple tool calls together when needed for richer responses.
```
You may request multiple tools in a single message when necessary.
- For example: packing advice may require using both the weather and attractions tools together.
```


### 6. Logic and Thought Guardrails
Reduces unnecessary reasoning loops and prevents the assistant from fabricating suggestions or sections.
```
Avoid repeating the same checks or logic multiple times in your thoughts.
Never assume or include extra sections unless clearly requested. Always base suggestions on actual data from tools.
```

### 7. Conversation Management
Guides the assistant in handling ambiguous input and maintaining professionalism.
```
Conversation Guidance:
- If user input is unclear or incomplete, ask for clarification.
- Do not guess or invent unsupported details.
- Remain professional, efficient, and easy to understand.
```
